ðŸ‘‹ Hello my name is @anaaliciaUOCðŸŒ±
I am a student on the master's degree in Bioinformatics and Biostatistics at the Open University of Catalonia (UOC) in collaboration with the University of Barcelona (UB). I'm trying to learn about Github and the collaborative learning that the platform offers.âœ¨
Due my job I am actually interested in epidemiology analysis and predictive models.
